Terraform Infrastructure for Kubernetes & Database Deployment

Overview

This Terraform configuration automates the deployment of a scalable Kubernetes cluster, a managed database, and a load balancer on AWS. It consists of modular components that ensure security, scalability, and maintainability.

Infrastructure Components

1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Creates a VPC with configurable CIDR blocks.
Defines both public and private subnets.
Supports multi-AZ deployment for high availability.

2. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Deploys a Kubernetes cluster within the VPC.
Supports autoscaling of worker nodes.
Uses private subnets for enhanced security.

3. RDS (Relational Database Service)

Deploys an RDS instance (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Supports multi-AZ failover.
Configurable parameters such as engine version and instance class.

4. ALB (Application Load Balancer)

Manages external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services in the cluster.
Includes security groups with proper ingress and egress rules.
Automatically provisions a security group with predefined rules.

5. Route 53 (DNS Management)

Provides a custom domain name for external access.
Links the ALB DNS name to a Route 53 record.

Future Enhancements

Implement Terraform state management using AWS S3.

Add monitoring with AWS CloudWatch and Prometheus.

Enable automated backup and disaster recovery solutions.

Implement IAM roles for Kubernetes service accounts and RDS access.

This Terraform configuration provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for deploying a Kubernetes cluster with a managed database and an external load balancer on AWS.
